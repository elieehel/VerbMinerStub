# VerbMinerStub
A stub project for a verb mining Burp Suite extension

**Interesting code is in src/burp/BurpExtender.java**

This is just a naÃ¯ve stub implementation used to issue `GET`, `POST`, and `OPTIONS` request to any previously unqueried URL that has been marked in scope in Burp Suite. The result of issued requests can be found under `Extender -> VerbMinerStub -> Output`.
